Compile:
- specify class files destination at compile: javac -d <destination> MyClass.java
- if destination directory does not exists - compiler error 

Launch application:
- do not specify the .class extension
- using properties: java -Dname=value MyClass

Using classpath:
- must be used both on compile and run to find classes
- classes are searched in specified order
- if same class in many locations, first location will be used without searching the other locations
- ex: javac -classpath /com/foo/acct:/com/foo
- current directory is not searched by default, it must be specified; ex: -classpath .:/foo
- classpath must find the class which is executed too

JAR files:
- include name of jar in path; ex: -classpath ws/myApp.jar

Static imports:
- import static variables and methods from other class
- if ambigous names - compiler error; 
ex: import static Integer.*;
    import static Long.*;
    // both Integer and Long have constant MAX_VALUE, if access it compiler error
